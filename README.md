An docker based nas system ... Lets contribute together!

## ideas

As a prerequisite, you will need docker that works on x86, i386 or arm
A rest api and command line interface should serve as a basis to control the nas. 
A webinterface and a kind of appstore should follow after that.
The whole in the programming language python version 3.
